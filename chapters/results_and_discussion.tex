\section{Results and discussion} \label{sec:results_and_discussion}

In this report, the smartphone application proposed in \cite{sohappy} was 
implemented on Android, utilizing machine learning techniques in order to 
perform face and smile detection.

Since the app was primarily intended to be used in research, it was designed
with interchangeability in mind, allowing it to be used and adjusted as 
necessary in future studies. Especially with mental health being an important
topic amidst the current pandemic, the soHappy app can be used to aid research 
in affective computing.

soHappy is a tool enabling studies to motivate participants to smile on a 
regular basis. At the same time, the results are recorded and can be evaluated 
by researchers. Participating in such studies requires little effort from the 
users.
