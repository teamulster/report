\section{Implementation} \label{sec:implementation}

The app is built using Kotlin. Kotlin is ``[...] an open-source statically 
typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript and 
Native.'' \cite{kotlin2020}
Google officially supports Kotlin for Android apps since 2017
\cite{googleio2017} and recommends using Kotlin since 2019
\cite{androidkotlin2019}.

Thanks to the similarity with languages like Java and TypeScript, adapting
Kotlin as programming language was relatively easy for the project team.

Various language features of Kotlin helped in development, too. Instead of
implementing the singleton pattern, Kotlin allows to create an single object
per runtime by using the \texttt{object}-Keyword.

Some design choices of the app were slowed down by Kotlin's language features.
As all Kotlin classes inherit from \texttt{Any}, using features of Java's 
\texttt{Object}-class are not natively available. This made using the methods
\texttt{.wait()} and \texttt{.notify()}, which are used for synchronisation,
more difficult.

``Android Studio'', known as the official integrated development environment 
(IDE) for Android development, allowed faster development thanks to useful
features like auto-completion. 

An Android app is built into an `apk'-file. In order to reduce application
size, soHappy differentiates between CPU architectures, and will
build an apk for each architecture. As a minimum SDK version, version 23
was chosen. This means that the app works on Android 6 and above.

In order to improve the code quality, a linting software called ``detekt'',
``[...] a static code analysis tool [...]''\cite{detekt2020} was used.

Various libraries were used to help implement the application. Using
the included build tool ``Gradle'' \cite{gradle} allowed easy management of 
dependencies. The following libraries are worth mentioning: CameraX 
\cite{camerax} is Android's newest library allowing access to the camera and 
providing an easy way to analyse captured images. ``GPUImage'' \cite{gpuimage}
allowed to apply filters onto the preview image. A library called ``Nitrite''
\cite{nitrite} allows to implement an NoSQL-Database storing our measurement 
locally.

For image analysis, we used the following libraries: Cascade based face
detection used the official `OpenCV4Android'-Library was used\cite{opencv4android}.
while machine learning based approaches utilised the official TFLite library.
\cite{tensorflow}

In order to train the CNN, which is explained in \ref{sec:methodology}, a
Python 3 script running in an Jupyter notebook was utilised. 
The Python TensorFlow library was used in combination with `Keras',
which allows creating an model architecture easily. In order to prepare the
training, test and validation data, the libraries `pandas', `pillow', 
`mathplotlib' and `numpy' were used.
