TensorFlow is a open source Machine Learning library developed by Google.
It supports a wide variety of programming languages, mainly targeting web and mobile applications.
Regarding soHappy we were looking for a lightweight open source approach to detect smiles. Since HaarCascade uses OpenCV which is great for detecting a user's face but struggles when it comes to smile/emotion detection, our choice fell to TensorFlow.
For mobile development TensorFlow provides a Lite version called TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) which can be easily included in a mobile app.
As a main advantage TFLite offered us the possibility to add a self-trained model to detect smiles. This was very helpful to reduce its more advanced emotion detection features to a simpler smile detection model.
As a second option we added a Face / Smile Detector implemented in Google's Android API (ML Kit) which also uses TensorFlow.
ML Kit comes with a model which is trained using Deep Machine Learning (DML).
DML increases both face and smile detection performance by a big margin.
As we didn't want to let our self-trained model slide, we sticked with our very own TFLite implementation as the default.
