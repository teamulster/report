Regarding soHappy, TesnorFlow \cite{tensorflow} appears to be a convenient fit when it comes to smile detection.
TensorFlow is a open source machine learning library developed by Google.
It supports a wide variety of programming languages, mainly targeting web and mobile applications.
For mobile development TensorFlow provides a Lite version called TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) which can be easily included in a mobile app.
The main advantage TFLite offers, is the ability to add a self trained model to detect smiles.
Depending on the dataset a model is trained with, TFLite usually is able to detect emotions, for example happiness or sadness.
However, soHappy only needs smile detection to comply with the core requirements.
Therefore its model can be broken down to simply detect smiling/happiness, rather than having the whole emotion detection.
As an alternative a Face/Smile Detector was implemented using Google's Android API (ML Kit) \cite{mlkit} which also utilizes TensorFlow.
ML Kit comes with a model trained using deep learning (DL).
DL increases both face and smile detection performance by a big margin.
The idea behind adding ML Kit besides already having OpenCV/self trained TFLite model, is to provide more exchangeablility of soHappy's core functionality and increase flexibility for a future study to easily add their own implementations.
