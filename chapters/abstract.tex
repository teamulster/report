Despite being of great importance not only to welfare, but also productivity,
mental health is often overlooked by many. Individuals affected by mental
disorders such as depression usually attempt to conceal their condition instead
of seeking professional aid, exacerbating symptoms. With technology steadily
advancing, using computing techniques to combat mental disorders has become
more feasible.
In this report, an Android application is implemented, intended to help
alleviate mental disorders by encouraging smiling, which has been shown
to be linked to happiness.
The resulting app is capable of estimating a user's happiness and can be
adjusted as necessary, rendering it suitable to be used in future studies.
